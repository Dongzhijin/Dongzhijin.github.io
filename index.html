            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>Hi, I am a graduate student specializing in Artificial Intelligence at Peking University. Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies in Intelligent Science and Technology with a double major in Economics at the Peking university. I am passionate about advancing AGI and solving real-world problems using AI technologies.
